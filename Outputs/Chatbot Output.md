## Savings Plan

**Track and cut top expenses**: Target 20% reductions in Moradia (negotiate rent/utilities), Alimentacao (cook more, limit eating out to R\$5,000/month), and Lazer (cancel non-essentials like Netflix/Game Pass, cap at R\$10,000/month) could save R\$60,000+ monthly.
**Automate savings**: Transfer 20% of salary (R\$92,600 from next paycheck) to a high-yield account immediately after deposits; aim for R\$20,000/month goal.
**Boost income and monitor**: Pursue more freelancing (e.g., Python gigs like your DIO courses), review weekly via dashboard sheet, and categorize all future transactions to hit 30% savings rate.
